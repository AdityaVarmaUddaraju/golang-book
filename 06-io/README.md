# Working with files and directories

You will use a combination of the libraries `os`, `io`, `io/ioutil` to work with files and directories.

Working with these libraries implies you are interested in doing the following:

- Read and write to files.
- Create, delete, and copy files and directories.
- Compress files and directories.
- Work with various file formats like JSON, CSV and XML.
