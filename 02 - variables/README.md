With variables, we can remember values and later refer to them via named references.

In Go, there are many ways to declare variables:

- define a name and type:

   ```golang
   var firstName string
   ```

- define a group of variables:

   ```golang
   var (
     firstName = "Chris"
     age = 20
   )
   ```

- define and assign a value:

   ```golang
   firstName := "Chris"
   ```
